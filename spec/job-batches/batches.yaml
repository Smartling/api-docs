      summary: Upload file to a batch
      description: >
        This endpoint is actually a proxy for Upload File in the Files API, and
        it works with these two differences:
         1. It additionally gets `batchUid` as a path parameter.
         2. It doesn't relay `localeIdsToAuthorize` to Files Api, therefore the file stays unauthorized. Instead, `localeIdsToAuthorize` are saved just for this batch session and are used when a file is being attached to a job.

        When the first file is added to the new batch, the batch changes to
        `ADDING_FILES` status. Adds original source content to a Job batch in
        Smartling.


        The curl example provided will upload your Java properties file directly
        to a Smartling project, identified by the `projectId`, and attaches it
        to a Job linked to `batchUid`. The response is returned right after the
        content of a file is accepted by the Files API. After that, the Batch
        service controls whether the file upload finished. Content is parsed,
        all strings are ingested, and the file is then attached to the Job which
        is linked to the batch for locales, described in `localeIdsToAuthorize`.

        Endpoint returns response as soon as a file is uploaded to jobs batch server.
        File is uploaded to FILE API asynchronously.

                  description: >
                    Specifies a custom charset for text-format files. The value
                    should be the name of the character set. See a full list of
                    supported character sets here.


                    If this directive is not used, Smartling will use the
                    ```Content-Type``` request header to determine if the
                    content is encoded with UTF-16, UTF-16B or UTF-16LE. If
                    there is no ```Content-Type``` header, Smartling will
                    examine the file for UTF-16 characters. If none are
                    detected, UTF-8 encoding will be used.


                    **Note**: Once this property has been set for a file, it
                    cannot be changed. If you reupload the file, it will use the
                    original charset, even if you change the directive. An error
                    will be returned if this directive is used when uploading
                    binary-format file types, such as Office or IDML files.

                callbackUrl:
                  description: >
                    A GET request that creates a callback to a URL when a file
                    is 100% published for a locale. The callback gives the
                    fileUri and locale with the format
                    `http[/s]://your.url?locale=xx-XX&fileUri=your.file`. If you
                    upload the file again, without a callbackUrl, it will remove
                    any previous callbackUrl for that file. The RequestBin
                    (http://requestb.in) service is a convenient way to test
                    callback. RequestBin generates a short-lived disposable URL
                    that displays all posted requests.


                    If a callback fails, Smartling will make multiple attempts
                    to reach the designated URL, however, we do not keep
                    retrying a failed callback indefinitely. Try to make sure
                    your callback URL is as stable as possible and be aware that
                    callbacks are not a 100% reliable way of being notified that
                    a file is published.


                    If the upload has begun but is taking more than a minute to
                    complete, it responds with status `202`.

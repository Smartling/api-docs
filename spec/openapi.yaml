  - name: Authentication
    description: |-
      Smartling uses OAuth2 for [authentication](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007789914).
      To access the Smartling APIs, you'll first need to authenticate with your
      user identifier and user secret. An access token is returned that can be
      attached to the header of any API request. A refresh token is also returned.

      To obtain your [user identifier and user secret](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004187694),
      log in to Smartling.com and go to **API > Create Token**. Authenticating is as
      simple as calling the `/api.smartling.com/auth-api/v2/authenticate` with
      your `userIdentifier` and `userSecret`. The access token returned is valid
      for 5-minutes, and is used in the header of all subsequent requests.

      **Example for generating your access token:**

      ```bash
      curl -X POST https://api.smartling.com/auth-api/v2/authenticate  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"userIdentifier": "userIdasdklj4348dk34!", "userSecret": "userSecret34i34kkd5634f"}'
      ```

      ```
      {
          "response": {
              "code": "SUCCESS",
              "data": {
                      "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJqdGkiOasdlkjn",
                      "refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJkMTdkMmEw",
                      "expiresIn": 480,
                      "refreshExpiresIn": 3660,
                      "tokenType": "Bearer"
              }
          }
      }
      ```

      **Example of using your access token to list all projects for your account:**

      ```bash
      curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}" https://api.smartling.com/accounts-api/v2/accounts/{accountUid}/projects
      ```

      ```
      {
          "response": {
              "code": "SUCCESS",
              "data": {
                  "totalCount": 1,
                  "items": [{
                               "projectId": "df324sdf5",
                               "projectName": "iOS Strings files",
                               "accountUid": "ab5f1939",
                               "archived": false,
                               "projectTypeCode": "APPLICATION_RESOURCES",
                               "sourceLocaleId": "en",
                               "sourceLocaleDescription": "English"
                           }
                  ]
              }
          }
      }
      ```

  - name: Account & Projects
    description: |-
      Each client within Smartling is given their own account with a designated
      `accountUid`. Within each account is any number of projects. All files,
      content, and jobs are tied to a particular project. The Accounts &
      Projects API will allow you to programmatically find and use the projects
      within your account.

      You may wish to reference the [Overview of Smartling
      APIs](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007811673) article
      to better understand how content is organized within Smartling.

  - name: Locales
    description: |-
      Locales are the language and country pairs that are used to identify the
      source content and the desired target locale for your translated content.

  - name: Peoples
    description: |-
      People - it is user of the system who works, processes, translates context.

  - name: Files
    description: |-
      Files are typically how you can exchange your content with Smartling to
      get translations. Smartling supports a wide variety of [file
      types](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007998893). When
      you upload a file to Smartling, it gets parsed into strings, which will
      then be sent into the translation queue.

  - name: Jobs
    description: |-
      A Smartling project (such as a mobile, web, files, or connector project)
      may contain one or more
      [jobs](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007790014). You may
      have multiple projects, each containing multiple jobs. Each job contains
      strings, consisting of words or phrases.

      The Jobs feature allows you to group and prioritize your content by name,
      due date, description, and reference number (optional). It also enables
      you to monitor the progress of your translations throughout completion.

      The Jobs API allows you to create a job, add a file to a job, authorize a
      job, and cancel a job, among many other actions. You have full control via
      the API to manage your job(s).

  - name: Job batches
    description: |-
      Job batches take care of asynchronous processes when uploading files and
      attaching them to jobs.

      Generally, adding multiple files to a job is associated with polling -
      file is parsed asynchronously and can't be added to a job until it is
      completed, adding file to a job is also asynchronous, and job can't be
      authorized until all background tasks completed.

      This forces third-party integration poll every file after every step.

      Batches hide these asynchronous processes from 3rd party integration -
      after it accepted file from client it conducts this file through all steps
      up to the Job authorization. As Job batch Service utilizes internal
      Smartling events it gets more effective than just polling files and jobs.

      From the client side flow consists of simple steps:

      1. Client creates Job (or uses existing one, which isn't currently
      processed with another Batch)

      2. Client Creates a new Batch for this Job

      3. Client adds (uploads) files into the batch giving target locales list
      for each file

      4. When all files are uploaded, client triggers "execute" for the batch.

      5. Batch execution process waiting until all files are uploaded and added
      to the Job and then, if was requested, authorizes the Job.

      6. Clients can check batch status and see if all files uploaded and
      attached successfully, what errors happened for each file, and statistics
      for added/skipped strings.

      After Batch is completed it can't be reused.

      **Job batches Limitations**

      - Service doesn't guarantee correct processing of multiple batches for the
      same job in parallel. Adding files to a new batch should be done only
      after previous batch reached "completed" state.

      - Service doesn't guarantee correct processing of Batch if Job and Files
      are modified in UI or with another integration.

  - name: Context
    description: |-
      [Visual context](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/categories/360000736674)
      helps Translators make linguistic, layout, and spacing decisions based on
      where strings appear in your mobile or desktop application. The Context
      API supports uploading various forms of context (images and HTML), and
      associate the context with content in Smartling.

  - name: Issues
    description: |-
      The Issues feature is a way for users who are working on a translation
      workflow to communicate with other users about source content and
      translations. For example, a Translator might create an
      [issue](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003139313) to ask
      a question about terminology in a particular string.

      By using Issues, you can record any communication about a string, and this
      can be seen by anyone working on it. Issues streamline the translation
      workflow. Translators get answers to their questions about the original
      content so they can translate it quickly and correctly. Translation
      resources can review and provide feedback about translations
      collaboratively.

      The Issues API provides methods for creating issues, changing the state of
      an issue, commenting on an issue, requesting detailed information, as well
      as creating reports on issues and comments.

  - name: Glossaries
    description: |-
      The Glossaries API allows you to create and edit glossaries in a Smartling
      account, and populate it with glossary terms. You can also download your
      glossaries as CSV or TBX files and import Excel spreadsheets to create new
      glossaries.

      **Glossaries API Usage Limitations**:
      * Maximum request size is 10MB.
      * Maximum file upload size is 10MB.
      * Maximum HTTP header size is 128KB.
      * For requests that use pagination, maximum page size is 5000 elements.
      * For requests that return entities by their UIDs, maximum is 100 elements.

      Rate limits:

      * Maximum 5 concurrent requests.
      * Maximum rate is 200 requests per 15-second window frame.

  - name: Strings
    description: |-
      A string is a piece of translation. Based on the source content, strings
      can be parsed differently. A string is then broken down further, into one
      or more segments.

      The Strings API allows you to directly upload strings to a Smartling
      project and fetch original strings or translations.

      For each string in a Smartling project, there is a unique identifier
      created by hashing together the parsed string text, [variant
      metadata](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008143853), and
      in some cases,
      [namespace](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008143833).
      When adding strings via the Strings API, each string will be unique. If
      you try to create a string with identical variant metadata and string text
      to a string that already exists in the project, the string will be
      overwritten.

  - name: Tags
    description: |-
      Tags can help you manage your strings. The Tags API allows you to
      add/remove string tags, and search for tags in a project.

  - name: Vendors
    description: |-
      The Vendors API is for Language Service Providers to view work that's
      available in Smartling.

  - name: Reports
    description: |-
      The Reports API allows to request various reports available on Smartling
      platform and specify additional filtering criteria to narrow down data
      returned by the reports.

  - name: Translation quality check
    description: Translation quality check service provides API that allows to check translation quality.

                    authorized is set to `true`. If a string has been completely
                    excluded for translation from all languages, or excluded
                    from translation for a specific language, `authorize` will
                    NOT authorize it.

                    To specify a limited list of locales to authorize, use the
                    `localeIdsToAuthorize[]` parameter.

                      Value | Description
                      ----- | -----------
                      true  |  Content will be available for translation in all locales upon upload.
                      false |  Content will be added to the "Awaiting Authorization" queue upon upload.
                'localeIdsToAuthorize[]':
                  description: |
                    This value, if set, authorizes strings for translation into
                    specific locales. Use the `project/locale/list` call to get
                    the list of locales for the project, or view them in the
                    dashboard on the API settings page. Use multiple the
                    `localeIdsToAuthorize` parameter pairs to authorize more
                    than one locale. You can add languages by uploading the file
                    again and indicating the language to authorize with
                    `localeIdsToAuthorize` or all languages with `authorize`, or
                    in the dashboard using the "Show Partially Authorized"
                    filter option from the Awaiting Authorization list.

                    If the string has been completely excluded for translation
                    from all languages, or excluded from translation for a
                    specific language, `localesIdsToAuthorize` will NOT
                    authorize it.

                    **Note**: Do not set the `authorize` parameter to `true` if
                    you want to specify individual locales to authorize.
                    Submitting an upload with both of these parameters set will
                    result in a validation error.

                    **Note**: While this parameter shares the format of other
                    file directives, it will not work as an inline directive and
                    must be specified in the API call.

                    Specifies a custom charset for text-format files. The value
                    should be the name of the character set. See a full list of
                    supported character sets here.

                    If this directive is not used, Smartling will use the
                    ```Content-Type``` request header to determine if the
                    content is encoded with UTF-16, UTF-16B or UTF-16LE. If
                    there is no ```Content-Type``` header, Smartling will
                    examine the file for UTF-16 characters. If none are
                    detected, UTF-8 encoding will be used.

                    **Note**: Once this property has been set for a file, it
                    cannot be changed. If you reupload the file, it will use the
                    original charset, even if you change the directive. An error
                    will be returned if this directive is used when uploading
                    binary-format file types, such as Office or IDML files.

                    A GET request that creates a callback to a URL when a file
                    is 100% published for a locale. The callback gives the
                    fileUri and locale with the format
                    `http[/s]://your.url?locale=xx-XX&fileUri=your.file`. If you
                    upload the file again, without a callbackUrl, it will remove
                    any previous callbackUrl for that file. The RequestBin
                    (http://requestb.in) service is a convenient way to test a
                    callback. RequestBin generates a short-lived disposable URL
                    that displays all posted requests.

                    If a callback fails, Smartling will make multiple attempts
                    to reach the designated URL. However, we do not keep
                    retrying a failed callback indefinitely. Try to make sure
                    your callback URL is as stable as possible and be aware that
                    callbacks are not a 100% reliable way of being notified that
                    a file is published.

                    If the upload has begun but is taking more than a minute to
                    complete, it responds with a `202` status.

        This downloads the original version of the requested file from
        Smartling.

        It is important to check the HTTP response status code. If Smartling
        finds and returns the file normally, you will receive a `200` SUCCESS
        response. If you receive a response status code other than `200`, the
        requested file will not be part of the response.

        When you upload a UTF-16 character encoded file, then /file/get requests
        for that file will have a character encoding of UTF-16. All other
        uploaded files will return with a character encoding of UTF-8.

        You can always use the content-type header in the response of a file/get
        request to determine the character encoding.

        The filename is based on the fileUri associated with the requested file.
        In most cases, the filename is exactly the fileUri provided. The only
        exception to this is with .pot gettext files. When a .pot file is
        specified as the fileUri, Smartling returns a .po file.

        When you upload a UTF-16 character encoded file, then /file/get requests
        for that file will have a character encoding of UTF-16. All other
        uploaded files will return with a character encoding of UTF-8.

        You can always use the content-type header in the response of a file/get
        request to determine the character encoding.

        **Note**: The filename in the response header is based on the fileUri
        associated with the requested file. In most cases, the filename is
        exactly the fileUri provided. The only exception to this is with .pot
        gettext files. When a .pot file is specified as the fileUri, Smartling
        returns a .po file.`

        Unlike the "Download translated file" endpoint, you get a ZIP archive
        with all translations of a specific file.

        It is important to check the HTTP response status code. If Smartling
        finds and returns the file normally, you will receive a `200` SUCCESS
        response. If you receive any other response status code than `200`, the
        requested files will not be part of the response.

        When you upload a UTF-16 character encoded file, then /file/get requests
        for that file will have a character encoding of UTF-16. All other
        uploaded files will return with a character encoding of UTF-8.

        Unlike "Download all translations of the file" you can specify multiple
        file URIs and locale IDs to select which files and languages you want to download.

        It is important to check the HTTP response status code. If Smartling
        finds and returns the file normally, you will receive a `200` SUCCESS
        response. If you receive any other response status code than `200`, the
        requested files will not be part of the response.

        When you upload a UTF-16 character encoded file, then /file/get requests
        for that file will have a character encoding of UTF-16. All other
        uploaded files will return with a character encoding of UTF-8.

        You can always use the content-type header in the response of a file/get
        request to determine the character encoding.

        **Example:**

        ```bash
          curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" 'https://api.smartling.com/files-api/v2/projects/{projectId}/files/zip?localeIds[]=de-DE&fileUris[]=yourfile.json'

        Smartling deletes files asynchronously and it typically takes a few
        minutes to complete. While deleting a file, you can not upload a file
        with the same `fileUri`.

        This call can be used instead of a standard upload/download if you keep
        different versions of a file in multiple branches or are triggering
        rebuilds, and don’t want your files in Smartling to be overwritten by
        out-of-date versions of a file.


        To use the call, you upload a file and identify the Smartling URI where
        the main version of that file is saved. Smartling will match strings
        shared between the uploaded file and the main file and return any
        available translations.

    post:
      summary: Upload new context
      description: |-
        Uploads a file or web link that can be linked to translations and shown
        to linguists as visual context for the strings they're working on.

        The following context types are supported:

        - **HTML**: HTML files or files with content type text/html
        - **IMAGE**: Image files
        - **VIDEO**: Public link to a video, such as:
          - YouTube link
          - Vimeo link
          - Link to an .mp4 file

        Context type is not specified directly, but rather, inferred via
        analyzing the request body.

        **Note**: If you are uploading **IMAGE** files, you will need to [run Automatic Context Matching](https://api-reference.smartling.com/#tag/Context/paths/~1context-api~1v2~1projects~1{projectId}~1contexts~1{contextUid}~1match~1async/post) after you upload new context. You can skip this step if you upload HTML files for context. 

        This endpoint accepts *multipart/form-data* request body.

                     - `text/html`

                    Maximum file upload size is `20MB`.

                    |----------|--------|
                    | `HTML` | Context URL or file name. If a valid URL is used, all relative links to resources within the context file will be resolved based on this URL. If the file name is used, the context file should have the `<base />` tag specified with the valid URL to resolve all relative links to resources. In all other cases, links to resources will not be resolved and the context might not show correctly. Defaults to context file name if not specified. |
                    | `IMAGE` | Image file name defaults to context file name if not specified. |
                    | `VIDEO` | Publicly available link to video. Required for this context type. |

      summary: Upload HTML file and match strings to create context bindings
      description: |-
        Uploads new HTML context and asynhronously matches it with strings.
        Strings to match are retrieved from the project specified by the `projectId` and
        can be filtered further by the optional `matchParams` parameter.

        If the uploaded file doesn't match any string, the context won't be created.
        Supported for `HTML` context only.

      summary: Run automatic context matching
      description: |-
        Automatically matches context against strings in the project and creates corresponding bindings.
        Optionally, you can restrict matching to only a set of strings that you specify to ensure that no unwanted
        bindings are created.

        Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is used for `IMAGE` context, while `HTML` context uses an approximate string matching algorithm.

        This is a convenient method provided to save time and complexity in your integration.
        While our OCR functionality is advanced, it cannot match 100% of strings. If you need complete context coverage,
        use either the manual Create Bindings request or check your context images in the Smartling Dashboard after
        running this request to fill in any blanks. Be mindful of the limitations of OCR if you are using an unusual or
        script-like font.

    post:
      summary: Create string to context bindings
      description: |-
        Link context files with the strings they contain.

        The binding tells Smartling to show Translators which context images for which strings.
        A maximum of `150` bindings can be created per request.

        A basic bindings request should contain an object with a `bindings` JSON array, with at least one element (binding) featuring `contextUid` and `stringHashcode` properties:
        ```JSON
        {
          "bindings": [
            {
               "contextUid": "25137b65-e075-4341-8362-14b1a3e558f5",
               "stringHashcode": "bd603147d945h3ec74d6874422ebe4e0"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        For `IMAGE` context, each binding may have additional `coordinates` data that specifies a rectangular area where the string is located in the image. If not specified, binding will still be created with coordinates `[0,0,0,0]`:
        ```JSON
        {
          "bindings": [
            {
               "contextUid": "25137b65-e075-4341-8362-14b1a3e558f5",
               "stringHashcode": "bd603147d945h3ec74d6874422ebe4e0",
               "coordinates": {
                  "top": 50,
                  "left": 50,
                  "width": 400,
                  "height": 400
               }
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        For `HTML` context, each binding may have the `selector` element with `anchors` array, specifying the enclosing the string HTML elements with the corresponding value of the `data-sl-anchor` attribute.
        If not specified, binding will still be created with the empty `anchors` array, effectively making it not anchored to a particular element and thus invisible in CAT Tool:
        ```JSON
        {
          "bindings": [
            {
               "contextUid": "25137b65-e075-4341-8362-14b1a3e558f5",
               "stringHashcode": "bd603147d945h3ec74d6874422ebe4e0",
               "selector": {
                  "anchors": ["custom.anchor", "11", 44"]
               }
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        For `VIDEO` context, each binding mave the `timecode` data, specifying the start and end time of the string appearance in the video:
        ```JSON
        {
          "bindings": [
            {
                "contextUid": "25137b65-e075-4341-8362-14b1a3e558f5",
                "stringHashcode": "bd603147d945h3ec74d6874422ebe4e0",
                "timecode": {
                   "startTime": 1203,
                   "endTime": 1450
                }
            }
          ]
        }

        **Note**: Only the author of an issue can perform this action. The
        `commentTextModifiedDate` property of an issue object shows when it was
        last updated.


        Comment text is treated as plain text. Smartling will save the text as
        provided and will not attempt to render this text with any special
        formatting in its UIs. It will not be rendered as HTML or markdown. If
        you're using the Issues API, escape the text as needed before attempting
        to render it. Maximum length is 4000 characters.

    post:
      summary: Add strings
      description: >-
        Uploads an array of strings to a Smartling project. A maximum of 100
        strings can be created per request. A request with more than 100 items
        will return an error. Each string has a character limit of 10,000.


        **Note**: You cannot authorize a string via API. Once you have created
        the strings, they will need to be authorized by a content owner in the
        Smartling Dashboard.


        Smartling creates a unique hashcode for each string based on the parsed
        string text and any variant or namespace metadata provided. If you
        upload a string with the same text, variant and namespace, and therefore
        the same hashcode, the existng string will be overwritten. This will not
        change the text of the string, but may update other metadata, such as
        placeholder and callback values. If the string is currently inactive,
        overwriting it will cause it to be reactivated. Overwritten strings
        return `"overWritten": "true"` in the response object.


        Most uploads will return a `200` response indicating success. If
        processing the request takes longer than 60 seconds, a `202` request
        will be returned, including a `processUid` value that can be used to
        check on the progress of the request.


        If you set up a POST callback for the string, you can automatically
        receive the translation for a string as soon as it is complete. See
        [Callbacks](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007829194)
        for more details.

        If an **Add strings** request takes longer than 60 seconds to process, a
        `202` response will be returned, indicating that the process of creating
        strings is continuing but not yet complete. This response will include a
        `proccessUid` value which can be used to check the progress of the
        request.


        This request can return:
          * `"processState": "OPEN"` which indicates that the request is still continuing.
          * `"processState": "CLOSED"` indicates the request has successfully completed.
          * `"processState": "FAILED"` means the request could not be completed.

        Processes have a limited lifespan after they are complete. This request
        will fail if you specify an expired `processUid`.

        response status is returned. The response contains a link and
        `processUid` to check the progress of the request. When a `202` is
        received, the process of adding the content to the job will not be
        complete until the returned process has completed.

      summary: Add file to job
      description: >
        This adds a file to a job. By default, the file will be added for all
        locales of the job, but you can change this by specifying
        `targetLocaleId`s for the job you wish to add the file into.


        **Validation rules:**

        - A job can contain a maximum of 5000 files.

        - Content can't be added to the job if the job doesn't contain any
        locales, and the request to add a file doesn't specify any locales.

        - The file (specified by the `fileUri`) can't be in the process of being
        uploaded / modified within Smartling. It should complete its upload
        process before being added to a job.

        - Any `targetLocale`s specified must be valid within the project the job
        has been created for.


        When the system can quickly add the file and its content to the job, it
        synchronously responds with status `200`. When the system cannot quickly
        add the file and its content to the job, then a `202` response is
        returned. The response contains a link to check the progress of the
        request. When a `202` is received, the process of adding the content to
        the job will not be complete until the returned process has completed.

        Removes a file from a job. All content that is part of the file
        contained within that job will be removed from the job and will become
        unauthorized content.


        When the system can quickly remove the file and its content from the job
        synchronously, it responds with a `200` status. When the system cannot
        quickly remove the file and its content from the job, a `202` response
        is returned. The response contains a link to check the progress of the
        request. When a `202` is received, the process of removing the file and
        its content from the job will not be complete until the returned process
        has completed.

        In the execution flow, the batch waits until upload and attach processes
        are completed successfully (or failed for any reason). When all of these
        asynchronous processes are completed, job `authorize` is triggered if it
        was requested, and the batch becomes a status of `COMPLETED`.


        Batch execution is allowed only if the batch is in `ADDING_FILES`
        status.

        This endpoint is actually a proxy for Upload File in the Files API, and

         1. It additionally gets `batchUid` as a path parameter.
         2. It doesn't relay `localeIdsToAuthorize` to Files Api, therefore the file stays unauthorized. Instead, `localeIdsToAuthorize` are saved just for this batch session and are used when a file is being attached to a job.

        The curl example provided will upload your Java properties file directly
        to a Smartling project, identified by the `projectId`, and attaches it
        to a Job linked to `batchUid`. The response is returned right after the

        service controls whether the file upload finished. Content is parsed,
        all strings are ingested, and the file is then attached to the Job which
        is linked to the batch for locales, described in `localeIdsToAuthorize`.

        Endpoint returns response as soon as a file is uploaded to jobs batch server. File is uploaded to FILE API in separate thread.

                    **Note**: While this parameter shares the format of other
                    file directives, it will not work as an inline directive and
                    must be specified in the API call.

                    supported character sets here.


                    If this directive is not used, Smartling will use the
                    ```Content-Type``` request header to determine if the
                    content is encoded with UTF-16, UTF-16B or UTF-16LE. If
                    there is no ```Content-Type``` header, Smartling will
                    examine the file for UTF-16 characters. If none are
                    detected, UTF-8 encoding will be used.


                    **Note**: Once this property has been set for a file, it
                    cannot be changed. If you reupload the file, it will use the
                    original charset, even if you change the directive. An error
                    will be returned if this directive is used when uploading
                    binary-format file types, such as Office or IDML files.

                  description: >
                    A GET request that creates a callback to a URL when a file
                    is 100% published for a locale. The callback gives the
                    fileUri and locale with the format
                    `http[/s]://your.url?locale=xx-XX&fileUri=your.file`. If you
                    upload the file again, without a callbackUrl, it will remove
                    any previous callbackUrl for that file. The RequestBin
                    (http://requestb.in) service is a convenient way to test
                    callback. RequestBin generates a short-lived disposable URL
                    that displays all posted requests.


                    If a callback fails, Smartling will make multiple attempts
                    to reach the designated URL, however, we do not keep
                    retrying a failed callback indefinitely. Try to make sure
                    your callback URL is as stable as possible and be aware that
                    callbacks are not a 100% reliable way of being notified that
                    a file is published.


                    If the upload has begun but is taking more than a minute to
                    complete, it responds with status `202`.

                    file is attached to a job.


                    **Note**: File will not be authorized for these locales once

                    for the file.


                    **Note**: While this parameter shares the format of other
                    file directives, it will not work as an inline directive and
                    must be specified in the API call.
                  type: string
                smartling.file_charset:
                  description: >
                    Specifies a custom charset for text-format files. The value
                    should be the name of the character set. See a full list of
                    supported character sets here.


                    If this directive is not used, Smartling will use the
                    ```Content-Type``` request header to determine if the
                    content is encoded with UTF-16, UTF-16B or UTF-16LE. If
                    there is no ```Content-Type``` header, Smartling will
                    examine the file for UTF-16 characters. If none are
                    detected, UTF-8 encoding will be used.


                    **Note**: Once this property has been set for a file, it
                    cannot be changed. If you reupload the file, it will use the
                    original charset, even if you change the directive. An error
                    will be returned if this directive is used when uploading
                    binary-format file types, such as Office or IDML files.

                    for more details.
                  type: string
                callbackUrl:
                  description: >
                    A GET request that creates a callback to a URL when a file
                    is 100% published for a locale. The callback gives the
                    fileUri and locale with the format
                    `http[/s]://your.url?locale=xx-XX&fileUri=your.file`. If you
                    upload the file again, without a callbackUrl, it will remove
                    any previous callbackUrl for that file. The RequestBin
                    (http://requestb.in) service is a convenient way to test
                    callback. RequestBin generates a short-lived disposable URL
                    that displays all posted requests.


                    If a callback fails, Smartling will make multiple attempts
                    to reach the designated URL, however, we do not keep
                    retrying a failed callback indefinitely. Try to make sure
                    your callback URL is as stable as possible and be aware that
                    callbacks are not a 100% reliable way of being notified that
                    a file is published.


                    If the upload has begun but is taking more than a minute to
                    complete, it responds with status `202`.

        Describes the location and size of a box enclosing the string in a

        left corner of the string (from the top left of the image). ‘width’ and
        ‘height’ are the dimensions of the string in pixels. This information is
        used to highlight the position of the string when displaying the context
        image in the translation interface (CAT tool). If coordinates are not
        provided, Smartling will attempt to locate the string on the image using
        Optical Character Recognition. If OCR fails, coordinates will default to
        0, 0, 0, 0. This meaans that the image will be displayed when the string
        is translated, without any highlighting to show the position of the
        string.

  - name: "Authentication"
    description: |-
      Smartling uses OAuth2 for [authentication](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007789914). To access the Smartling APIs, you'll first need to authenticate with your user identifier and user secret. An access token is returned that can be attached to the header of any API request. A refresh token is also returned.
      
      To obtain your [user identifier and user secret](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004187694), log in to Smartling.com and go to **API > Create Token**. Authenticating is as simple as calling the `/api.smartling.com/auth-api/v2/authenticate` with your `userIdentifier` and `userSecret`. The access token returned is valid for 5-minutes, and is used in the header of all subsequent requests.

      **Example for generating your access token:**

      ```bash 
        curl -X POST https://api.smartling.com/auth-api/v2/authenticate  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{    "userIdentifier": "userIdasdklj4348dk34!", "userSecret": "userSecret34i34kkd5634f" }'`
      ```
      ```
      {
          "response": {
              "code": "SUCCESS",
              "data": {
                      "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJqdGkiOasdlkjn",
                      "refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJkMTdkMmEw",
                      "expiresIn": 480,
                      "refreshExpiresIn": 3660,
                      "tokenType": "Bearer"
              }
          }
      }
      ```

      **Example of using your access token to list all projects for your account:**

      ```bash
        curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}" 'https://api.smartling.com/accounts-api/v2/accounts/{accountUid}/projects
      ```
      ```
      {
          "response": {
              "code": "SUCCESS",
              "data": {
                  "totalCount": 1,
                  "items": [{
                               "projectId": "df324sdf5",
                               "projectName": "iOS Strings files",
                               "accountUid": "ab5f1939",
                               "archived": false,
                               "projectTypeCode": "APPLICATION_RESOURCES",
                               "sourceLocaleId": "en",
                               "sourceLocaleDescription": "English"
                           }
                  ]
              }
          }
      }

  - name: "Account & Projects"
    description: |-
      Each client within Smartling is given their own account with a designated `accountUid`. Within each account is any number of projects. All files, content, and jobs are tied to a particular project. The Accounts & Projects API will allow you to programmatically find and use the projects within your account.

      You may wish to reference the [Overview of Smartling APIs](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007811673) article to better understand how content is organized within Smartling.

  - name: "Locales"
    description: |-
      Locales are the language and country pairs that are used to identify the source content and the desired target locale for your translated content.

  - name: "Files"
    description: |-
      Files are typically how you can exchange your content with Smartling to get translations. Smartling supports a wide variety of [file types](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007998893). When you upload a file to Smartling, it gets parsed into strings, which will then be sent into the translation queue.

  - name: "Jobs"
    description: |-
      A Smartling project (such as a mobile, web, files, or connector project) may contain one or more [jobs](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007790014). You may have multiple projects, each containing multiple jobs. Each job contains strings, consisting of words or phrases.
      The Jobs feature allows you to group and prioritize your content by name, due date, description, and reference number (optional). It also enables you to monitor the progress of your translations throughout completion.

      The Jobs API allows you to create a job, add a file to a job, authorize a job, and cancel a job, among many other actions. You have full control via the API to manage your job(s).

  - name: "Job batches"
    description: |-
      Job batches take care of asynchronous processes when uploading files and attaching them to jobs.
      Generally, adding multiple files to a job is associated with polling - file is parsed asynchronously and can't be added to a job until it is completed, adding file to a job is also asynchronous, and job can't be authorized until all background tasks completed.  
      This forces third-party integration poll every file after every step.  

      Batches hide these asynchronous processes from 3rd party integration - after it accepted file from client it conducts this file through all steps up to the Job authorization. As Job batch Service utilizes internal Smartling events it gets more effective than just polling files and jobs.
      From the client side flow consists of simple steps:

      1. Client creates Job (or uses existing one, which isn't currently processed with another Batch)
      2. Client Creates a new Batch for this Job
      3. Client adds (uploads) files into the batch giving target locales list for each file
      4. When all files are uploaded, client triggers "execute" for the batch.
      5. Batch execution process waiting until all files are uploaded and added to the Job and then, if was requested, authorizes the Job.
      6. Clients can check batch status and see if all files uploaded and attached successfully, what errors happened for each file, and statistics for added/skipped strings.

      After Batch is completed it can't be reused.

      **Job batches Limitations**
      - Service doesn't guarantee correct processing of multiple batches for the same job in parallel. Adding files to a new batch should be done only after previous batch reached "completed" state.
      - Service doesn't guarantee correct processing of Batch if Job and Files are modified in UI or with another integration.

  - name: "Context"
    description: |-
      [Visual context](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/categories/360000736674) helps Translators make linguistic, layout, and spacing decisions based on where strings appear in your mobile or desktop application. The Context API supports uploading various forms of context (images and HTML), and associate the context with content in Smartling.

  - name: "Issues"
    description: |-
      The Issues feature is a way for users who are working on a translation workflow to communicate with other users about source content and translations. For example, a Translator might create an [issue](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003139313) to ask a question about terminology in a particular string.

      By using Issues, you can record any communication about a string, and this can be seen by anyone working on it. Issues streamline the translation workflow. Translators get answers to their questions about the original content so they can translate it quickly and correctly. Translation resources can review and provide feedback about translations collaboratively. 


      The Issues API provides methods for creating issues, changing the state of an issue, commenting on an issue, requesting detailed information, as well as creating reports on issues and comments.

  - name: "Glossaries"
    description: |-
      The Glossaries API allows you to create and edit glossaries in a Smartling account, and populate it with glossary terms. You can also download your glossaries as CSV or TBX files and import Excel spreadsheets to create new glossaries.

      **Glossaries API Usage Limitations**:
      * Maximum request size is 10MB.
      * Maximum file upload size is 10MB.
      * Maximum HTTP header size is 128KB.
      * For requests that use pagination, maximum page size is 5000 elements.
      * For requests that return entities by their UIDs, maximum is 100 elements.

      Rate limits:
      * Maximum 5 concurrent requests.
      * Maximum rate is 200 requests per 15-second window frame.

  - name: "Strings"
    description: |-
      A string is a piece of translation. Based on the source content, strings can be parsed differently. A string is then broken down further, into one or more segments.
      
      The Strings API allows you to directly upload strings to a Smartling project and fetch original strings or translations.

      For each string in a Smartling project, there is a unique identifier created by hashing together the parsed string text, [variant metadata](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008143853), and in some cases, [namespace](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008143833). When adding strings via the Strings API, each string will be unique. If you try to create a string with identical variant metadata and string text to a string that already exists in the project, the string will be overwritten.

  - name: Tags
    description: |-
      Tags can help you manage your strings. The Tags API allows you to add/remove string tags, and search for tags in a project.

            Determines whether content in the file is authorized (available for translation) in all locales upon submitting the file via the Smartling Dashboard. An error message will be returned if there are insufficient translation funds and authorized is set to `true`. If a string has been completely excluded for translation from all languages, or excluded from translation for a specific language, `authorize` will NOT authorize it. 

            To specify a limited list of locales to authorize, use the `localeIdsToAuthorize[]` parameter.

            This value, if set, authorizes strings for translation into specific locales. Use the `project/locale/list` call to get the list of locales for the project, or view them in the dashboard on the API settings page. Use multiple the `localeIdsToAuthorize` parameter pairs to authorize more than one locale. You can add languages by uploading the file again and indicating the language to authorize with `localeIdsToAuthorize` or all languages with `authorize`, or in the dashboard using the "Show Partially Authorized" filter option from the Awaiting Authorization list.

            If the string has been completely excluded for translation from all languages, or excluded from translation for a specific language, `localesIdsToAuthorize` will NOT authorize it. 

            **Note**: Do not set the `authorize` parameter to `true` if you want to specify individual locales to authorize. Submitting an upload with both of these parameters set will result in a validation error.

            If this directive is not used, Smartling will use the ```Content-Type``` request header to determine if the content is encoded with UTF-16, UTF-16B or UTF-16LE. If there is no ```Content-Type``` header, Smartling will examine the file for UTF-16 characters. If none are detected, UTF-8 encoding will be used.

            **Note**: Once this property has been set for a file, it cannot be changed. If you reupload the file, it will use the original charset, even if you change the directive. An error will be returned if this directive is used when uploading binary-format file types, such as Office or IDML files.

          description: |
            A GET request that creates a callback to a URL when a file is 100% published for a locale. The callback gives the fileUri and locale with the format `http[/s]://your.url?locale=xx-XX&fileUri=your.file`. If you upload the file again, without a callbackUrl, it will remove any previous callbackUrl for that file. The RequestBin (http://requestb.in) service is a convenient way to test a callback. RequestBin generates a short-lived disposable URL that displays all posted requests.

            If a callback fails, Smartling will make multiple attempts to reach the designated URL. However, we do not keep retrying a failed callback indefinitely. Try to make sure your callback URL is as stable as possible and be aware that callbacks are not a 100% reliable way of being notified that a file is published.

            If the upload has begun but is taking more than a minute to complete, it responds with a `202` status.

        It is important to check the HTTP response status code. If Smartling finds and returns the file normally, you will receive a `200` SUCCESS response. If you receive a response status code other than `200`, the requested file will not be part of the response.

        When you upload a UTF-16 character encoded file, then /file/get requests for that file will have a character encoding of UTF-16. All other uploaded files will return with a character encoding of UTF-8.

        You can always use the content-type header in the response of a file/get request to determine the character encoding.
        
        The filename is based on the fileUri associated with the requested file. In most cases, the filename is exactly the fileUri provided. The only exception to this is with .pot gettext files. When a .pot file is specified as the fileUri, Smartling returns a .po file.

        This downloads the requested file from Smartling.

        It is important to check the HTTP response status code. If Smartling finds and returns the file normally, you will receive a `200` SUCCESS response. If you receive any other response status code other than `200`, the requested file will not be part of the response.

        When you upload a UTF-16 character encoded file, then /file/get requests for that file will have a character encoding of UTF-16. All other uploaded files will return with a character encoding of UTF-8.

        You can always use the content-type header in the response of a file/get request to determine the character encoding.

        **Note**: The filename in the response header is based on the fileUri associated with the requested file. In most cases, the filename is exactly the fileUri provided. The only exception to this is with .pot gettext files. When a .pot file is specified as the fileUri, Smartling returns a .po file.`

        Temporarily uploads a file, then returns a translated version for requested locales.

        This call can be used instead of a standard upload/download if you keep different versions of a file in multiple branches or are triggering rebuilds, and don’t want your files in Smartling to be overwritten by out-of-date versions of a file.

        To use the call, you upload a file and identify the Smartling URI where the main version of that file is saved. Smartling will match strings shared between the uploaded file and the main file and return any available translations.

            | `HTML` | Context URL or file name. If a valid URL is used, all relative links to resources within the context file will be resolved based on this URL. If the file name is used, the context file should have the `<base />` tag specified with the valid URL to resolve all relative links to resources. In all other cases, links to resources will not be resolved and the context might not show correctly. Defaults to context file name if not specified. |
            | `IMAGE` | Image file name defaults to context file name if not specified. |
            | `VIDEO` | Publicly available link to video. Required for this context type. |

      summary: Run automatic context matching
      description: |-
        Automatically matches context against strings in the project and creates corresponding bindings.
        Optionally, you can restrict matching to only a set of strings that you specify to ensure that no unwanted
        bindings are created.

        Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is used for `IMAGE` context, while `HTML` context uses an approximate string matching algorithm.

        This is a convenient method provided to save time and complexity in your integration.
        While our OCR functionality is advanced, it cannot match 100% of strings. If you need complete context coverage,
        use either the manual Create Bindings request or check your context images in the Smartling Dashboard after
        running this request to fill in any blanks. Be mindful of the limitations of OCR if you are using an unusual or
        script-like font.

    post:
      summary: Create string to context bindings
      description: |-
        Link context files with the strings they contain. 

        The binding tells Smartling to show Translators which context images for which strings.
        A maximum of `150` bindings can be created per request. 
        
        A basic bindings request should contain an object with a `bindings` JSON array, with at least one element (binding) featuring `contextUid` and `stringHashcode` properties:
        ```JSON
        {
          "bindings": [
            {
               "contextUid": "25137b65-e075-4341-8362-14b1a3e558f5",
               "stringHashcode": "bd603147d945h3ec74d6874422ebe4e0"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
        
        For `IMAGE` context, each binding may have additional `coordinates` data that specifies a rectangular area where the string is located in the image. If not specified, binding will still be created with coordinates `[0,0,0,0]`:
        ```JSON
        {
          "bindings": [
            {
               "contextUid": "25137b65-e075-4341-8362-14b1a3e558f5",
               "stringHashcode": "bd603147d945h3ec74d6874422ebe4e0",
               "coordinates": {
                  "top": 50,
                  "left": 50,
                  "width": 400,
                  "height": 400
               }
            }
          ]
        }```
        
        For `HTML` context, each binding may have the `selector` element with `anchors` array, specifying the enclosing the string HTML elements with the corresponding value of the `data-sl-anchor` attribute. 
        If not specified, binding will still be created with the empty `anchors` array, effectively making it not anchored to a particular element and thus invisible in CAT Tool:
        ```JSON
        {
          "bindings": [
            {
               "contextUid": "25137b65-e075-4341-8362-14b1a3e558f5",
               "stringHashcode": "bd603147d945h3ec74d6874422ebe4e0",
               "selector": {
                  "anchors": ["custom.anchor", "11", 44"]
               }
            }
          ]
        }```
        
        For `VIDEO` context, each binding mave the `timecode` data, specifying the start and end time of the string appearance in the video:
        ```JSON
        {
          "bindings": [
            {
                "contextUid": "25137b65-e075-4341-8362-14b1a3e558f5",
                "stringHashcode": "bd603147d945h3ec74d6874422ebe4e0",
                "timecode": {
                   "startTime": 1203,
                   "endTime": 1450
                }
            }
          ]
        }```

  /strings-api/v2/projects/{projectId}:
    post:
      summary: "Add strings"
      description: |-
        Uploads an array of strings to a Smartling project. A maximum of 100 strings can be created per request. A request with more than 100 items will return an error. Each string has a character limit of 10,000.

        **Note**: You cannot authorize a string via API. Once you have created the strings, they will need to be authorized by a content owner in the Smartling Dashboard.

        Smartling creates a unique hashcode for each string based on the parsed string text and any variant or namespace metadata provided. If you upload a string with the same text, variant and namespace, and therefore the same hashcode, the existng string will be overwritten. This will not change the text of the string, but may update other metadata, such as placeholder and callback values. If the string is currently inactive, overwriting it will cause it to be reactivated. Overwritten strings return `"overWritten": "true"` in the response object.

        Most uploads will return a `200` response indicating success. If processing the request takes longer than 60 seconds, a `202` request will be returned, including a `processUid` value that can be used to check on the progress of the request.

        If you set up a POST callback for the string, you can automatically receive the translation for a string as soon as it is complete. See [Callbacks](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007829194) for more details.

        If an **Add strings** request takes longer than 60 seconds to process, a `202` response will be returned, indicating that the process of creating strings is continuing but not yet complete. This response will include a `proccessUid` value which can be used to check the progress of the request. 

        This request can return:
          * `"processState": "OPEN"` which indicates that the request is still continuing. 
          * `"processState": "CLOSED"` indicates the request has successfully completed.
          * `"processState": "FAILED"` means the request could not be completed.

        Processes have a limited lifespan after they are complete. This request will fail if you specify an expired `processUid`.

        Adding strings to a job is useful if you don't manage strings / content through files, but instead need to add strings by some other means other than files.

        When strings are successfully added to a job, a `200` status is returned. When the system can't quickly add strings to the job, a `202` response status is returned. The response contains a link and `processUid` to check the progress of the request. When a `202` is received, the process of adding the content to the job will not be complete until the returned process has completed.

        This adds a file to a job. By default, the file will be added for all locales of the job, but you can change this by specifying `targetLocaleId`s for the job you wish to add the file into. 

        **Validation rules:**
        - A job can contain a maximum of 5000 files.
        - Content can't be added to the job if the job doesn't contain any locales, and the request to add a file doesn't specify any locales.
        - The file (specified by the `fileUri`) can't be in the process of being uploaded / modified within Smartling. It should complete its upload process before being added to a job.
        - Any `targetLocale`s specified must be valid within the project the job has been created for.

        When the system can quickly add the file and its content to the job, it synchronously responds with status `200`. When the system cannot quickly add the file and its content to the job, then a `202` response is returned. The response contains a link to check the progress of the request. When a `202` is received, the process of adding the content to the job will not be complete until the returned process has completed.

      description: |
        This removes a locale from a job. When removing a locale from a job (and thus any content within that job for that locale), the content being removed will be unauthorized.

        When the system can quickly remove the locale and any content from the job, it synchronously responds with status `200`. When the system cannot quickly remove the locale and any content from the job, then a `202` response is returned. The response contains a link to check the progress of the request. When a `202` is received, the process of removing the content from the job will not be complete until the returned process has completed.

        Triggers asynchronous execution of a batch.
        
        In the execution flow, the batch waits until all files are uploaded and attached, or fails on one of those operations. When all of these asynchronous processes are completed, job `authorize` is triggered if it was requested, and the batch becomes a status of `COMPLETED`.

        Batch execution is allowed only if the batch is in `ADDING_FILES` status.

      summary: Add file to a batch
      description: |
        This endpoint is actually a proxy for Upload File in the Files API, and it works with these two differences:
         1. It additionally gets `batchUid` as a path parameter.
         2. It doesn't relay `localeIdsToAuthorize` to Files Api, therefore the file stays unauthorized. Instead, `localeIdsToAuthorize` are saved just for this batch session and are used when a file is being attached to a job.

        When the first file is added to the new batch, it becomes an `ADDING_FILES` status. Adds original source content to a Job batch in Smartling.

        The example will upload your Java properties file directly to a Smartling project, identified by the `projectId`, and attaches it to a Job linked to `batchUid`. The response is returned right after the content of a file is accepted by the Files API. After that, the Batch service controls whether the file upload finished. Content is parsed, all strings are ingested, and the file is then attached to the Job which is linked to the batch for locales, described in `localeIdsToAuthorize`.

          **Note**: While this parameter shares the format of other file directives, it will not work as an inline directive and must be specified in the API call.

          Specifies a custom charset for text-format files. The value should be the name of the character set. See a full list of supported character sets here.

          If this directive is not used, Smartling will use the ```Content-Type``` request header to determine if the content is encoded with UTF-16, UTF-16B or UTF-16LE. If there is no ```Content-Type``` header, Smartling will examine the file for UTF-16 characters. If none are detected, UTF-8 encoding will be used.

          **Note**: Once this property has been set for a file, it cannot be changed. If you reupload the file, it will use the original charset, even if you change the directive. An error will be returned if this directive is used when uploading binary-format file types, such as Office or IDML files.

        description: |
          A GET request that creates a callback to a URL when a file is 100% published for a locale. The callback gives the fileUri and locale with the format `http[/s]://your.url?locale=xx-XX&fileUri=your.file`. If you upload the file again, without a callbackUrl, it will remove any previous callbackUrl for that file. The RequestBin (http://requestb.in) service is a convenient way to test callback. RequestBin generates a short-lived disposable URL that displays all posted requests.

          If a callback fails, Smartling will make multiple attempts to reach the designated URL, however, we do not keep retrying a failed callback indefinitely. Try to make sure your callback URL is as stable as possible and be aware that callbacks are not a 100% reliable way of being notified that a file is published.

          If the upload has begun but is taking more than a minute to complete, it responds with status `202`.

This information is used to highlight the position of the string when displaying the context image in the translation interface (CAT tool). If coordinates are not provided, Smartling will attempt to locate the string on the image using Optical Character Recognition. If OCR fails, coordinates will default to 0, 0, 0, 0. This meaans that the image will be displayed when the string is translated, without any highlighting to show the position of the string.

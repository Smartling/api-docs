      summary: Upload file to a batch
      description: |-
        This endpoint is actually a proxy for Upload File in the Files API, and
        it works with these two differences:
         1. It additionally gets `batchUid` as a path parameter.
         2. It doesn't relay `localeIdsToAuthorize` to Files Api, therefore the file stays unauthorized. Instead, `localeIdsToAuthorize` are saved just for this batch session and are used when a file is being attached to a job.

        Upload is only possible if the file was declared in the `Create Batch` request or added with `REGISTER_FILE` action.
        When the first file is uploaded to the new batch, the batch status changes
        to `ADDING_FILES`. Adds original source content to a Job batch in Smartling.

        The provided curl example will upload your Java properties file directly
        to a Smartling project, identified by the `projectId`, and attaches it
        to a Job linked to `batchUid`. The response is returned right after the
        content of a file is accepted by the Files API. After that, the Batch
        service controls whether the file upload finished. Content is parsed,
        all strings are ingested, and the file is then attached to the Job which
        is linked to the batch for locales, described in `localeIdsToAuthorize`.

        Endpoint returns response as soon as a file is uploaded to job batches server.
        File is uploaded to FILE API asynchronously.

        **Common issues**:

        * Each file must include the `fileUri` registered with the batch, upon upload. For example, if you have created a batch with the single file URI `test1.xml` and you attempt to upload this with the file URI `test2.xml` it will fail, and you will get an error. But you can always use `REGISTER_FILE` action.
        * File URI's must be unique per batch, even if you want to authorize it to two or more locales. For example, if you have file `test1.xml` that should be authorized for `es` and `de`, and you attempt to upload it twice (`fileUri=test1.xml` + `localeIdsToAuthorize[]=es` and `fileUri=test1.xml` + `localeIdsToAuthorize[]=de`), it will fail and you will get an error. The second upload will be rejected and file will be authorized only for `es` locale. You must always pass all desired locales with the registered fileUri (`fileUri=test1.xml` + `localeIdsToAuthorize[]=es,de`).

                    **Note**: While this parameter shares the format of other
                    file directives, it will not work as an inline directive and
                    must be specified in the API call.

                    supported character sets here.


                    If this directive is not used, Smartling will use the
                    ```Content-Type``` request header to determine if the
                    content is encoded with UTF-16, UTF-16B or UTF-16LE. If
                    there is no ```Content-Type``` header, Smartling will
                    examine the file for UTF-16 characters. If none are
                    detected, UTF-8 encoding will be used.


                    **Note**: Once this property has been set for a file, it
                    cannot be changed. If you reupload the file, it will use the
                    original charset, even if you change the directive. An error
                    will be returned if this directive is used when uploading
                    binary-format file types, such as Office or IDML files.

                  description: >
                    A GET request that creates a callback to a URL when a file
                    is 100% published for a locale. The callback gives the
                    fileUri and locale with the format
                    `http[/s]://your.url?locale=xx-XX&fileUri=your.file`. If you
                    upload the file again, without a callbackUrl, it will remove
                    any previous callbackUrl for that file. The RequestBin
                    (http://requestb.in) service is a convenient way to test
                    callback. RequestBin generates a short-lived disposable URL
                    that displays all posted requests.


                    If a callback fails, Smartling will make multiple attempts
                    to reach the designated URL, however, we do not keep
                    retrying a failed callback indefinitely. Try to make sure
                    your callback URL is as stable as possible and be aware that
                    callbacks are not a 100% reliable way of being notified that
                    a file is published.


                    If the upload has begun but is taking more than a minute to

    post:
      summary: Create translation job
      description: |
        Creates a new translation job or fetches an existing one based on the specified criteria.

        **Purpose**: This endpoint simplifies the common workflow where you need to obtain a translation job for file uploads
        without managing the full complexity of job creation. It's particularly useful in automation scripts (e.g., bash scripts)
        and integration scenarios where you have a desired job name and simply need to get a `translationJobUid` to proceed
        with file uploads. The job can be reviewed and configured later through the Smartling dashboard.

        **When to use this endpoint**:
        - You need a simple "get or create" job operation by name
        - You're building file upload workflows and need a job quickly
        - You're writing automation scripts or integrations

        **When to use the standard Jobs API instead**: If you require full control over job creation with all available
        parameters (custom fields, reference numbers, due dates, etc.), please use the
        [Jobs API Create Job endpoint](#operation/addJob).
        This endpoint intentionally provides a simplified interface focused on the most common use case.

        **Dynamic job naming**: The `nameTemplate` parameter supports date pattern placeholders using Java `DateTimeFormatter`
        syntax (e.g., `{yyyy}`, `{QQQ}`). These patterns are evaluated at request time using the specified `timeZoneName`.

        **Job creation behavior** depends on the `mode` parameter:

        - **REUSE_EXISTING**: Returns an existing job if one matches the evaluated name template. If the matching job is
          closed or completed, creates a new job with a unique name using the specified `salt` strategy.
        - **CREATE_NEW**: Attempts to create a new job with the evaluated name. If a job with that name already exists,
          appends a unique identifier using the specified `salt` strategy to ensure creation succeeds.

        **Examples**:

        1. **Quarterly localization job**:
           ```json
           {
             "nameTemplate": "Q{QQQ} {yyyy} Localization",
             "timeZoneName": "America/New_York",
             "mode": "REUSE_EXISTING"
           }
           ```
           Evaluates to: "Q1 2025 Localization" (when called in Q1 2025)

        2. **Daily content updates**:
           ```json
           {
             "nameTemplate": "Daily Update {yyyy-MM-dd}",
             "timeZoneName": "Europe/London",
             "mode": "REUSE_EXISTING"
           }
           ```
           Evaluates to: "Daily Update 2025-10-08"

        3. **Always unique jobs**:
           ```json
           {
             "nameTemplate": "Feature Release {yyyy}",
             "mode": "CREATE_NEW",
             "salt": "TIMESTAMP"
           }
           ```
           Creates: "Feature Release 2025 2025-10-08 02:34:15 PM" (if job already exists)

        nameTemplate:
          description: |
            The name template for the job, used to identify or create the job. Must be a non-empty string.

            **Dynamic date patterns**: The template supports date pattern placeholders enclosed in curly braces `{}`, which are
            evaluated at request time using Java `DateTimeFormatter` syntax. Patterns are replaced with actual date/time values
            based on the specified `timeZoneName` (or server time if not specified).

            **Common pattern examples**:
            - `{yyyy}` - Four-digit year (e.g., "2025")
            - `{yy}` - Two-digit year (e.g., "25")
            - `{QQQ}` - Quarter of year (e.g., "Q1", "Q2")
            - `{QQQQ}` - Full quarter text (e.g., "1st quarter")
            - `{MM}` - Month as two digits (e.g., "01", "12")
            - `{MMM}` - Short month name (e.g., "Jan", "Dec")
            - `{dd}` - Day of month (e.g., "08", "25")
            - `{yyyy-MM-dd}` - ISO date format (e.g., "2025-10-08")

            **Examples**:
            - `"Q{QQQ} {yyyy} Localization"` → evaluates to "Q1 2025 Localization" (in Q1 2025)
            - `"Daily Update {yyyy-MM-dd}"` → evaluates to "Daily Update 2025-10-08"
            - `"Release {yyyy}"` → evaluates to "Release 2025"

            For complete pattern syntax, refer to the
            [Java DateTimeFormatter documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html).

      default: REUSE_EXISTING
      description: >-
        Determines job creation behavior. Defaults to REUSE_EXISTING.


        - **REUSE_EXISTING** (default): Returns an existing job if one matches the evaluated `nameTemplate`. If the
          matching job is closed or completed (final state), automatically creates a new job with a unique name by
          appending a salt identifier. This mode is ideal for workflows where you want to reuse active jobs but ensure
          work continues when previous jobs are closed.

        - **CREATE_NEW**: Attempts to create a new job with the evaluated `nameTemplate`. If a job with that exact name
          already exists, automatically appends a salt identifier to create a job with a unique name. If no job exists
          with that name, creates the job without salt modification.
    JobBatchJobCreationSalt:
      type: string
      enum:
        - RANDOM_ALPHANUMERIC
        - TIMESTAMP
      default: RANDOM_ALPHANUMERIC
      description: >-
        Determines the format of the unique identifier appended to job names when necessary to avoid conflicts.
        Defaults to RANDOM_ALPHANUMERIC. Salt is applied based on the `mode` parameter behavior.


        **When salt is applied**:

        - With **REUSE_EXISTING**: Salt is appended when an existing job with the evaluated name is in a closed or completed
          state, ensuring a new unique job is created.

        - With **CREATE_NEW**: Salt is appended when a job with the evaluated name already exists, regardless of status.


        **Salt formats**:

        - **RANDOM_ALPHANUMERIC** (default): Appends a space and 5 random alphanumeric characters to the job name
          (e.g., "My Job aB3x9").

        - **TIMESTAMP**: Appends a space and formatted timestamp in "yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss a" format, evaluated using the
          specified `timeZoneName` (e.g., "My Job 2025-10-08 02:34:15 PM").
